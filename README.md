## üìñ Overview  

This repository accompanies the survey paper:  

> **Bring Complex Geometric Information to LLMs: A Positional Survey of Graph Parametric Representation**  
> *Dongqi Fu\*, Liri Fang\*, Zihao Li\*, Zhe Xu\*, Hanghang Tong, Vetle I. Torvik, Jingrui He*  
> *Learning on Graphs Conference (LoG) 2025*  

Graphs capture relational and geometric structures in the real world ‚Äî from molecules to social networks.  
However, **LLMs lack native mechanisms to encode or reason over graphs.**  
This survey proposes **Graph Parametric Representations (Graph Laws)** as a natural bridge, offering interpretable, low-entropy summaries that encode the statistical regularities of graph topology in a language-friendly form.
